3. Operational efficiency 

Operational efficiency is key objective for any organization. As efficiency comes from within, it is important to empower your change management or transformation teams with knowledge and understanding of your current processes. That way, they are better positioned to continuously identify and eliminate inefficient ways of working.

4. Rapid process discovery

Rapid Process Discovery is a core component of organizational agility. Serious events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout coming from it, are creating a clear view of how organizations are under-prepared to adapt their operating models and processes quickly enough to not only thrive but in some cases merely survive disruptors such as these.

However, these unprecedented disruptors are providing us with a semblance of a roadmap that the organizations who can understand their processes, use data to accelerate decision making, leverage the knowledge of their workforce and, from that, build the right disciplines and procedures to adjust quickly to change, will be the winners moving forward.

5. Complience and risk management 

Compliance and the effective management of risk have wide ranging implications for operational efficiency. The larger the organization, and the more tightly regulated the industry, the greater their influence. Getting “ahead of the curve” when it comes to meeting compliance obligations can make the difference between success and failure. Moving from a reactive state to a proactive stance on the identification, management and mitigation of risk can ensure your business continuously meets its compliance obligations.
